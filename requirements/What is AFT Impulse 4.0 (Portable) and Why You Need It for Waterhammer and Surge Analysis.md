# AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable): A Powerful Tool for Waterhammer Analysis
 
Waterhammer is a phenomenon that occurs when a fluid in motion is suddenly stopped or changed by a valve, pump, or other device. Waterhammer can cause severe damage to pipes, fittings, valves, pumps, and other equipment, as well as pose safety risks to personnel and the environment. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and prevent waterhammer effects in any piping system that involves fluid transients.
 
One of the most advanced and user-friendly software tools for waterhammer analysis is AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable). AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) is a software application that allows you to model fluid transients in pipe networks using the Method of Characteristics. AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) can help you design and operate your system with greater safety and reliability by:

- Avoiding potentially catastrophic effects of waterhammer and other undesirable system transients
- Preventing transient pressure issues by properly sizing and locating surge equipment, such as surge tanks, gas accumulators, and relief valves
- Initiating transients based on time or events in the system
- Reducing surge magnitudes by adjusting system component transients such as valve closure time or pump speed
- Easily animating and visualizing a waterhammer event to improve fundamental understanding
- Calculating transient unbalanced forces and defining forces sets as location pairs or single points
- Specifying design alerts that automatically highlight output values that are out of range for flow, peak pressure, velocity, and more
- Compiling libraries of your frequently used piping components and quickly selecting them from a drop down list
- Modeling liquid column separation caused by transient cavitation
- Evaluating the effect of pressure surges due to vapor cavity collapse
- Determining imbalanced pipe forces and sizing structural supports
- Troubleshooting existing systems to determine the cause of operational problems

AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) is designed for systems containing fluids such as water, petroleum and refined products, chemicals, cryogens and refrigerants[^1^]. It can handle various applications such as water distribution systems, fire protection systems, oil and gas pipelines, chemical plants, power plants, HVAC systems, and more[^1^]. AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) also has add-on modules for settling slurry analysis and pulsation frequency analysis[^2^].
 
AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) is a portable version of AFT Impulse 4.0 that can be run from a USB flash drive or other removable media without installation[^3^]. This makes it convenient for engineers who need to use the software on different computers or locations. AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable) is copy protected and requires a valid license to run[^2^]. You can request a quote or a free trial from the official website of Applied Flow Technology (AFT), the developer of AFT Impulse 4.0 (Portable)[^1^].
