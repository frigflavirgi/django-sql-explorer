The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the band's musical diversity and experimentation, while others criticized the album's production and lack of cohesion. The album sold poorly compared to the band's previous albums, and failed to chart in any major markets.

The album has since gained a cult following among some fans of the band and the genre.
